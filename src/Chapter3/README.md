# Stacks and Queues

**Stack** - a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

* push, which adds an element to the collection, and
* pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, **LIFO (last in, first out)**.

* Properties:
    * Sequential Access - access elements from most recent.

**Queue** - a queue is an abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and
 addition of entities are place on the rear and access from the front:
 
* enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as 
* dequeue. 

This makes the queue a **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** data structure. 

* Properties:
    * Sequential Access - access elements from first to last.
    
* Types of Queues

    1. Simple Queue - one way in one way out
    2. Circular Queue - is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end 
    3. Priority Queue - is an abstract data type similar to queue, but each element has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.
    4. Dequeue (Double Ended Queue) - is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail)
